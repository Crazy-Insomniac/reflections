When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

I would want to use it for back up, collaboration, or to simply give my 
code to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Why might I want to pull my changes manually? I suspect it's to avoid 
potential conflicts in the code. I may be in the middle of adding a 
feature for example, the last thing I may have wanted is to have my 
progress interupted when another contributer has updated to the 
repository.
