What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I assume it's because you need to initialise before you can create a 
commit. Initializing creates a .git file and creates a foundation to 
store all the revisions hidden away.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a set up for what's to be put in to the repository.
That way you don't have commit everything from the working directory to 
the repository in one go. Creating multiple commits instead allows me 
break down the working directory into logical segments to commit.
